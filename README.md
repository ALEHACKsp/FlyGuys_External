# FlyGuys_External
It's fully external cheat to Fall Guys, based on https://github.com/B3akers/FlyGuys. It uses "il2cppconverter" which is poorly implemented method to make il2cpp.h useful in external projects, better option is to modify Il2cppDumper code itself.
# Features
- Fly mode
- No collisions (you will still get pushed by external forces)
- No stun
- Speed boost
- ESP for real doors (Door rush)
- ESP for real tiles (TipToe)
# Updates
Update offsets same like in internal and run program with CONVERT 1 to create new il2cpp_external.cpp and il2cpp_external.h which is in mostly cases not necessary because structs doesn't change
